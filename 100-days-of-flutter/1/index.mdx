{/* # Day 1: Getting Started with Flutter */}

Welcome to Day 1 of the "Hundred Days of Flutter" course! Today, we'll set up your development environment and introduce you to the basics of Dart, the programming language used for Flutter development.

## Course Introduction

"Hundred Days of Flutter" is designed to take you from a beginner to a competent Flutter developer in 100 days, spending just 2 hours per day. By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Build cross-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android
- Implement complex UI designs with Flutter's widget system
- Manage app state effectively
- Integrate with backend services and databases
- Deploy your applications to app stores

The course is structured into five phases:

1. Flutter Fundamentals (Days 1-20)
2. Architecture & State Management (Days 21-40)
3. Data & Backend Integration (Days 41-60)
4. Advanced UI & UX (Days 61-80)
5. Deployment & Advanced Topics (Days 81-100)

Each day builds upon the previous, so it's important to follow the course in order.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Let's start by setting up everything you need to build Flutter apps.

### Installing Flutter SDK

1. Go to the [Flutter installation page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Select your operating system and follow the instructions

### Setting Up an IDE

You can use either Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Both are excellent choices for Flutter development.

#### Visual Studio Code Setup

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the Flutter and Dart extensions:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Flutter" and install the Flutter extension (this will also install the Dart extension)

#### Android Studio Setup

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Install the Flutter and Dart plugins:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to Preferences/Settings > Plugins
   - Search for "Flutter" and install the Flutter plugin (this will also install the Dart plugin)
   - Restart Android Studio

### Setting Up Emulators/Simulators

Testing your apps requires either a physical device or an emulator/simulator.

#### Android Emulator

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools > AVD Manager
3. Click "Create Virtual Device"
4. Select a device (e.g., Pixel 4) and click "Next"
5. Select a system image (e.g., Android 11) and click "Next"
6. Name your AVD and click "Finish"

#### iOS Simulator (macOS only)

1. Install Xcode from the App Store
2. Open Xcode and accept the license agreement
3. Install additional components if prompted
4. Open Simulator from Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator

### Verifying Installation

Let's make sure everything is set up correctly:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Run `flutter doctor`
3. Address any issues reported by the doctor

The output should look something like this:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.10.6, on macOS 13.5.1)
[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS
[✓] Chrome - develop for the web
[✓] Android Studio (version 2022.2)
[✓] VS Code (version 1.81.1)
[✓] Connected device (2 available)
[✓] Network resources
```

## Introduction to Dart

Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. Let's explore the basics of Dart.

### What is Dart?

Dart is a client-optimized language developed by Google for building apps on multiple platforms. It's the language behind Flutter and is designed to be fast, object-oriented, and easy to learn.

### Basic Syntax and Variables

Let's write our first Dart code:

```dart
void main() {
  // This is a comment
  print('Hello, Dart!');

  // Variables
  String name = 'Flutter Developer';
  int daysInCourse = 100;
  double hoursPerDay = 2.0;
  bool isExcited = true;

  // String interpolation
  print('Welcome, $name!');
  print('You will spend ${daysInCourse * hoursPerDay} hours in this course.');

  // var - type inferred by the compiler
  var age = 25; // int
  var price = 19.99; // double

  // final - value cannot be changed after initialization
  final String courseName = 'Hundred Days of Flutter';

  // const - compile-time constant
  const int weeksInCourse = 14;
}
```

### Variable Types in Dart

Dart is a statically typed language, which means variable types are known at compile time. Here are the basic types:

- `int`: Integer values
- `double`: Floating-point numbers
- `bool`: Boolean values (true/false)
- `String`: Text values
- `List`: Ordered group of items
- `Map`: Key-value pairs
- `Set`: Unordered collection of unique items

### Creating Your First Flutter App

Now, let's create our first Flutter application:

1. Open a terminal and run:

```
flutter create my_first_app
cd my_first_app
```

2. Open the project in your IDE

3. Run the app:

```
flutter run
```

You should see the default counter app that Flutter creates. Congratulations! You've just run your first Flutter app.

### Exploring the Default App

Let's take a quick look at the structure of the default Flutter app:

- `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point for your app
- `pubspec.yaml`: Manages dependencies and assets
- `android/` and `ios/`: Platform-specific code
- `test/`: Contains test files

Open `lib/main.dart` to see the code for the default counter app. Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet—we'll explore this in detail over the coming days.

## Knowledge Check

Let's test your understanding of today's concepts:

<MCQ
  question="Which language is used to develop Flutter applications?"
  options={[
    { text: "JavaScript", hint: "Used for web development and React Native" },
    { text: "Kotlin", hint: "Used for native Android development" },
    {
      text: "Dart",
      hint: "Created by Google specifically for client applications",
    },
    { text: "Swift", hint: "Used for native iOS development" },
  ]}
  correctOption={2}
/>

<MCQ
  question="Which keyword is used to declare a variable that can't be changed after initialization?"
  options={[
    { text: "var", hint: "This is for type inference" },
    { text: "final", hint: "Value is set at runtime and cannot be changed" },
    { text: "const", hint: "Value is determined at compile time" },
    { text: "static", hint: "Related to class-level properties" },
  ]}
  correctOption={1}
/>

<MCQ
  question="What is the primary command to check if your Flutter installation is correct?"
  options={[
    { text: "flutter check", hint: "Not a standard Flutter command" },
    { text: "flutter run", hint: "Used to run a Flutter app" },
    {
      text: "flutter doctor",
      hint: "Diagnoses issues with your Flutter installation",
    },
    { text: "flutter verify", hint: "Not a standard Flutter command" },
  ]}
  correctOption={2}
/>

## Mini-Challenge: Personalize Your First App

Modify the default counter app to display your name instead of "Flutter Demo Home Page".

Here's how:

1. Open `lib/main.dart`
2. Find the line with `title: 'Flutter Demo'`
3. Change it to `title: 'Your Name's App'`
4. Find the `MyHomePage` class and modify its title parameter
5. Run the app to see your changes

## Key Takeaways
