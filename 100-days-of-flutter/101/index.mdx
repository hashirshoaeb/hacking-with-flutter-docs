## Understanding State Management Fundamentals

Hey there! If youâ€™re like most developers, you probably first encountered a state management library through a YouTube tutorialâ€”maybe it was during a late-night coding session, chasing quick fixes for your project. You learned to use it in that specific example, but when it came to implementing it in your project, you struggled. Sound familiar? The problem is often not knowing whatâ€™s happening under the hood.

Letâ€™s fix that! First, we need to understand why state management is important, what it aims to solve, and how it works. This will help you know when to use aÂ `StatefulWidget`Â and when a state management library is the better choice.

## Why Use a State Management Library?

Good software design follows the principle ofÂ **low coupling and high cohesion**Â ([geeksforgeeks explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-coupling-and-cohesion/)). The purpose of state management is toÂ **decouple**Â the state from the UI. By doing this, the state and UI become independent and reusable.

Let me break it down with an example:

Imagine you have some data points (state) and filters (actions) that modify the data. In your UI, you have two charts: a bar graph and a pie chart. Without state management, the state and UI are tightly coupled, making it hard to reuse. With a state management solution, the state is independent, so both charts can use the same data and filters seamlessly.

The ultimate goal is to haveÂ **low coupling**Â between state and UI. Ready to build your own state management solution? Letâ€™s dive in!

## Key Concepts: Streams and Events

Imagine youâ€™re standing by a river with a friend. The river flows from a mountain (where you are) to a lake (where your friend is). You decide to send paper boats downstream. Each boat is numbered, and when your friend catches one, they shout the number back to you.

In Dart, this river is like aÂ **Stream**. The boats areÂ **data events**Â (or state), and your friend is theÂ **listener**Â (the UI component). Hereâ€™s how we can model this activity in Dart:

```dart:example.dart
import 'dart:async';

class RiverActivity {
  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<int> _streamController = StreamController<int>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<int> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void sendBoat(int boatNumber) {
    _streamController.sink.add(boatNumber);
  }

  // close the river
  void closeActivity() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

void main() {
  final riverActivity = RiverActivity();

  // your friend listening at lake
  final subscription = riverActivity.stream.listen((boatNumber) {
    print('Shout out loud: I received boat $boatNumber');
  });

  // you sending boat 1 by 1 after every second from top
  int boatLabel = 1;
  Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (t) {
    riverActivity.sendBoat(boatLabel);
    if (boatLabel == 10) {
      t.cancel();
      riverActivity.closeActivity();
      return;
    }
    boatLabel++;
  });
}
```

See how the listener (your friend) responds whenever a new event (boat) arrives? Thatâ€™s how streams and listeners work in Dart.

## Building a Counter App Without StatefulWidget

Now, letâ€™s apply this concept. What if we wanted to build a simple counter app using onlyÂ `StatelessWidget`? Hereâ€™s the challenge:

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterWidget({super.key});
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    _counter++;
    print(_counter);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      spacing: 12.0,
      children: [
        Text('$_counter'),
        OutlinedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

[Run this code on dart pad here.](https://dartpad.dev/?id=fbc0b058d883a1bae2acabb80442b146)

Try running this code. Youâ€™ll see theÂ `_counter`Â variable updating in the console, but the UI doesnâ€™t change. Why? Because the UI isnâ€™tÂ **listening**Â to the state changes.

## Using Streams for State Management

Letâ€™s fix this by applying our river activity theory:

```dart
class CounterActivity {
  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<int> _streamController = StreamController<int>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<int> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void updateCounter(int count) {
    _streamController.sink.add(count);
  }

  // close the river
  void closeActivity() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterWidget({super.key});
  int _counter = 0;
  final counterActivity = CounterActivity();

  void _incrementCounter() {
    _counter++;
    counterActivity.updateCounter(_counter);
    print(_counter);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      spacing: 12.0,
      children: [
        StreamBuilder<int>(
          initialData: _counter,
          stream: counterActivity.stream,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            return Text('${snapshot.data}');
          },
        ),
        OutlinedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

```

[Run this code on dart pad here.](https://dartpad.dev/?id=837333814c83be4ad3154507f44aa4a0)

[StreamBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html)Â is a widget that rebuilds itself whenever there is new event data by re-running its builder function.

So, we have created a stream of counter events, where on pressing the button, the counter data is sent downstream, like a paper boat being put into the river at the top of the hill. TheÂ `StreamBuilder`, which listens to the stream at the lakeside, rebuilds theÂ `Text`Â widget with the data it receives.

Congratulations! You have successfully decoupled state and UI on your own without using any third-party state management library.

## Refining the Solution

You might notice a warning aboutÂ `CounterWidget`Â being immutable but having mutable fields. To fix this, move all mutable state logic intoÂ `CounterActivity`:

```dart
class CounterActivity {
  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<int> _streamController = StreamController<int>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<int> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  int _counter = 0;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void incrementCounter() {
    _counter++;
    _streamController.sink.add(_counter);
    print(_counter);
  }

  // close the river
  void closeActivity() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterWidget({super.key});

  final counterActivity = CounterActivity();

  void _incrementCounter() {
    counterActivity.incrementCounter();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      spacing: 12.0,
      children: [
        StreamBuilder<int>(
          initialData: 0,
          stream: counterActivity.stream,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            return Text('${snapshot.data}');
          },
        ),
        OutlinedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: const Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

```

[Run this code on dart pad here.](https://dartpad.dev/?id=4e8db6d82d869e7595268d8a4c5d9916)

Now theÂ `CounterWidget`Â remains truly immutable, and all the logic resides withinÂ `CounterActivity`.

## Final Thoughts

Youâ€™ve just built a basic state management solution using Dart streams. This approach helps you understand the principles behind state management libraries and makes it easier to decide when and why to use them. Keep exploring, and youâ€™ll master state management in no time!

## We Accidentally Created a Bloc Library! ðŸ¤¯

Okay, hear me out. Without even realizing it, weâ€™ve basically built our own state management library. And guess what? It looks a lot like `bloc`!

Letâ€™s break this down and see how we got here.

## Spotting the Repetition ðŸ‘€

Take a look at these two classes: `CounterActivity` and `RiverActivity`. At first glance, they seem different, but if you look closely, there's a _lot_ of duplicated code.

```dart
class CounterActivity {
  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<int> _streamController = StreamController<int>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<int> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  CounterActivity(this.counter);

  int counter;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void incrementCounter() {
    counter++;
    _streamController.sink.add(counter);
    print(counter);
  }

  // close the river
  void closeActivity() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

```

```dart
class RiverActivity {
  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<int> _streamController = StreamController<int>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<int> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void sendBoat(int boatNumber) {
    _streamController.sink.add(boatNumber);
  }

  // close the river
  void closeActivity() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

```

Do you see it? Both classes:

- Create a `StreamController`
- Expose a `stream`
- Have a function that adds data to the stream (`incrementCounter` vs `sendBoat`)
- Provide a method to close the stream

Thatâ€™s a lot of repeated logic. As good developers, we know what to do nextâ€”**refactor!**

## Extracting the Common Logic ðŸ”„

Instead of repeating ourselves, letâ€™s use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to extract all the shared logic into a base class.

```dart
abstract class Activity<T> {
  Activity(this.state);
  T state;

  // creating a river for activity
  final StreamController<T> _streamController = StreamController<T>();

  // stream of river you can listen to at lake side
  Stream<T> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  // Let you sail/sink your boat into the stream of river from top hill
  void emit(T state) {
    _streamController.sink.add(state);
  }

  // close the river
  void close() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

```

Now, both `CounterActivity` and `RiverActivity` can simply extend this base class.

```dart
class CounterActivity extends Activity<int> {
  CounterActivity(super.state);

  void incrementCounter() {
    state++;
    emit(state);
    print(state);
  }
}

```

Cleaner, right? But weâ€™re not stopping here.

## Making Life Even Easier ðŸ˜Œ

Letâ€™s say we often use `StreamBuilder` to listen to our streams. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we had a **custom widget** that automatically does this for any `Activity` class? Well, letâ€™s build it! ðŸš€

```dart
class ActivityBuilder<B extends Activity<S>, S> extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context, S state) builder;
  final B activity;

  const ActivityBuilder({
    super.key,
    required this.builder,
    required this.activity,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<S>(
      stream: activity.stream,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        return builder(context, snapshot.data ?? activity.state);
      },
    );
  }
}

```

Now, instead of using `StreamBuilder` manually, we can simply do this:

```dart
ActivityBuilder<CounterActivity, int>(
  activity: counterActivity,
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Text('$state');
  },
),

```

[Run this code on dart pad here.](https://dartpad.dev/?id=9d47d54a714d2b3af12d0a4c65582089)

Looks familiar? It should! This is exactly how `BlocBuilder` works in the `bloc` package. But waitâ€”what if we rename `Activity` to `Cubit` and `ActivityBuilder` to `BlocBuilder`?

## _Boom!_ We Just Built Bloc ðŸŽ‰

```dart
abstract class Cubit<T> {
  Cubit(this.state);
  T state;

  final StreamController<T> _streamController = StreamController<T>();

  Stream<T> get stream => _streamController.stream;

  void emit(T state) {
    _streamController.sink.add(state);
  }

  void close() {
    _streamController.close();
  }
}

```

```dart
class BlocBuilder<B extends Cubit<S>, S> extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget Function(BuildContext context, S state) builder;
  final B bloc;

  const BlocBuilder({
    super.key,
    required this.builder,
    required this.bloc,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<S>(
      stream: bloc.stream,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        return builder(context, snapshot.data ?? bloc.state);
      },
    );
  }
}

```

## Mind. Blown. ðŸ¤¯

With just a little bit of refactoring, we unintentionally built a lightweight state management solution that looks a _lot_ like the `bloc` package. We now have:

- `Cubit` for managing state
- `BlocBuilder` for listening to state changes
- A clean, reusable pattern for handling streams

This proves that `bloc` isnâ€™t some magic frameworkâ€”itâ€™s just **good programming principles** applied correctly.

So, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You now have your own state management solution. And if you ever wondered _how_ bloc works under the hoodâ€”well, now you know. ðŸ˜‰

Happy coding! ðŸš€
